# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/locks/BasicLiquidityLock.sol [Line: 13](src/locks/BasicLiquidityLock.sol#L13)

	```solidity
	    function withdraw(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId) external override onlyOwner {
	```

	```solidity
	    function withdraw(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId) external override onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>

	```

## L-3: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity

	```solidity
	        feeCollector = _newFeeCollector;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event FeeAmountNormalUpdated(uint256 newFee);
	```

## L-5: Internal functions called only once can be inlined

Instead of separating the logic into a separate function, consider inlining the logic into the calling function. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve readability.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/LiquidityLockFactory.sol [Line: 188](src/LiquidityLockFactory.sol#L188)

	```solidity
	    function isContractDeployed(address _contract) internal view returns (bool) {
	```

</details>



## L-6: State variable changes but no event is emitted.

State variable changes in this function but no event is emitted.

	```solidity
